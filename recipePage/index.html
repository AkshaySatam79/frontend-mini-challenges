    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul id="ingredients">
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk or water (optional, for fluffiness)</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon butter or olive oil
      </li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
      </li>
      <li>Chopped fresh chives or parsley for garnish (optional)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><span>Whisk the eggs:</span>Crack the eggs into a medium bowl. Add the milk (or water), salt, and pepper.
        Whisk the mixture until it is completely blended and uniform in color.</li>
      <li><span>Heat the pan:</span>Melt the butter in a small non-stick skillet over medium heat.
      </li>
      <li><span>Cook the eggs:</span>Pour the egg mixture into the hot skillet. Let the eggs cook for a few seconds
        without stirring until the edges begin to set.</li>
      <li><span>Scramble:</span>Use a rubber spatula to gently pull the cooked eggs from the edges to the center of the
        pan, allowing the uncooked egg to flow to the bottom.</li>
      <li><span>Finish cooking:</span>Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring occasionally, until
        the eggs are mostly set but still glisten with moisture. Do not overcook, as they will continue cooking off the
        heat.</li>
      <li><span>Serve:</span>Remove the pan from the heat immediately. Garnish with chives or parsley if desired, and
        serve immediately.
      </li>
